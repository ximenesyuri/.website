# Overview

The lib consists of two parts:
1. a `component system`, which allows to define components and operate between them following a functional approach, being compatible with [jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/), [alpine.js](), [htmx.js](), [flexsearch](), and much more;
2. an `app system`, which is an extension of [fastapi](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi) to include, for example, the construction of static applications, all of that provided in a highly intuitive interface.

 Both parts are constructed focused in providing type safety, which is ensured through an extensive use of [ximenesyuri/typed](https://github.com/ximenesyuri/typed) and [ximenesyuri/utils](https://github.com/ximenesyuri/utils).
