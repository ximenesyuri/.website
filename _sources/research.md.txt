My research is maily on abstraction processes applied to different branches, as Mathematics, Physics, Philosophy and Computer Science. Some examples of abstraction process are "generalization" and "unification". Another example is the so-called "categorification", which involves embedding an area inside [Category Theory](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category+theory). 

I can say that most of my work is related (some part more directly, another part more indirectly) to the "Axiomatization Problem of Physics", which can be viewed as a modern interpretation of [Hilbert's sixth problem](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Hilbert%27s+sixth+problem), one of the [Millennium problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems).

As an example of what I study, you can see [this](https://) research project. You can also take a look at [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/a/martins_y_1.html) and [HAL](https://hal.science/search/index?q=yuri+ximenes+martins).
