```

I do research in topics related to __abstraction processes__ in the interface between Mathematics, Philosophy, Physics and Computer Science, with a particular interest in foundational aspects. 

As a researcher, I like to formalize things.

As a developer, I'm involved mostly with procedural and functional programming. 

I'm also an active Linux user and a Vim lover. I like to stay in the comfort of my terminal emulator.
