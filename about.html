<p>My name is “Yuri Ximenes Martins”. I’m a Brazilian researcher and software developer.</p>
<p>As a researcher my main interest in abstracting and formalizing. I believe that every concept has a very simple and intuitive presentation, which can be discovered through a full abstraction process. My works meet different areas, as Mathematics, Physics, Philosophy and Computer Science. For details on my publications, see <a href=/publications>publications</a>.</p>
<p>As a developer, I follow a similar philosophy: I believe in minimal, modular and abstract solutions. This means that I will include a dependency only if it is absolutely needed. Also, I will always try to break my software in smaller reusable pieces. That said, I prefer procedural and functional approaches. Finally, I do not believe in perfect or predefined complex inner architectures. More specifically, I think that abstraction should appear first in code, and then, only when really needed, in the architectural layer.</p>
<p>Naturally, I also have some perspective in mixing research and development. Indeed, due my interest in foundational and formal aspects, it is natural to try a computational approach through the use of proof assistants, as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Coq</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Lean</span></code>, which is part of my plan.</p>
<p>I’m a strong Linux user. For the environment I use, see <a href=/setup>setup</a>.</p>
<p>Besides the technical scope, I follow a minimalist lifestyle and I like to be rounded of nature.</p>
