Hi.

My name is "Yuri Ximenes Martins". I'm a Brazilian researcher and software developer.
      
As a researcher my main interest in abstracting and formalizing. I believe that every concept has a very simple and intuitive presentation, which can be discovered through a full abstraction process. My works meet different areas, as Mathematics, Physics, Philosophy and Computer Science. For details on my publications, see <a href=/publications>publications</a>.

As a developer, I follow a similar philosophy: I believe in minimal, modular and abstract solutions. This means that I will include a dependency only if it is absolutely needed. Also, I will always try to break my software in smaller reusable pieces. That said, I prefer procedural and functional approaches. Finally, I do not believe in perfect or predefined complex inner architectures. More specifically, I think that abstraction should appear first in code, and then, only when really needed, in the architectural layer.

Naturally, I also have some perspective in mixing research and development. Indeed, due my interest in foundational and formal aspects, it is natural to try a computational approach through the use of proof assistants, as `Coq` and `Lean`, which is part of my plan.

I'm a strong Linux user. For the environment I use, see <a href=/setup>setup</a>.

Besides the technical scope, I follow a minimalist lifestyle and I like to be rounded of nature.
